# BUGS


# TWEEKS

- [ ] 
- [X] Under auditory responsiveness and visual responsiveness instead of 'none' but "Not Expected"
- [X] The report should include the selection from the search page
	- For example search type, active missing person, adult, etc. should show in the report as well
	- The report, instead of saying'session', should say'search information' and should show search name, team name, Then the selection information at the search level;
	- After that, each segment added's information should be displayed
	- It should not say "segment 1: unnamed". It should just show the name of the segment, Most segments will be called Segment 1, Segment 2, etc. This would cause confusion since somebody might only be assigned Segment 5 through 7
	- In the report after the search level information is displayed, there can be a heading called "Search Areas"
	- Average POD can be displayed slightly smaller in the report
	- In the report the generated date should be in the format  mmmm dd, yyyy
	- For the segments, remove the space after inputs before its bullets start
	- [X] Under Evidence/Historical Search, searching for you should not be able to unselect remains and evidence. At least one needs to be selected
	- You can select one or the other or both but not none
	- If evidence is selected, one of large evidence or small evidence or both needs to be selected. You should not be able to deselect both
- [X] Tool Tip for Vegetation Train and Detectability:
	- Instead of it saying "natural shelters" or "hard to spot natural shelters", delete the first one and just say "hard to spot natural shelters"
	- Update to say "evidence buried under duff layer" instead of "in duff layer"
- [X] Segment start time and segment end time are still not a 24-hour clock
- [X] For vegetation, terrain, and detectability stack the selection options on top of each other vertically
- [X] In the report section the primary POD and average POD should be presented As discussed below.
	- Each individual target or subject being searched for should continue to be displayed as currently shown
	- Please add a quick tooltip note above the detailed calculation that says "for development only"
- [X] Instead of 'detectability level' it should say Vegetation / Terrain / Detectability
- [X] Under weather change buttons to:
	- Clear
	- Raining
	- Snowing
- [X] After critical spacing, put "(m)" Instead of meters
- [X] Remove "required" after segment name
- [X] All titles of fill fields should have their first letter capitalized. For example "Segment Name" vs "Segment name"
- [X] Add small font tool tips as follows:
	- Search page
		- Do not include case numbers or subjects' names. Should appear exactly as written, but directly below search name above the fill field
		- For active missing person, under Search for, add a tool tip directly below that says "Select all that apply"
	- Segment page
		- Under critical spacing, add distance between searchers as a tool tip
		- Under area coverage add "Account for incomplete segments or unsearchable area."
		- Under Vegetation / Terrain / Detectability Tooltips should say "Consider All factors that would make your primary subject more difficult to spot. For example, evidence burried in duff layer, snow cover, hiding places, natural shelters, or hard-to-spot natural shelters, dense vegetation, etc."
- [X] Detectability level should be defined beside each option as follows:
	1 - Low Concealment
	2 - Low/Moderate Concealment
	3 - Moderate Concealment
	4 - Moderate/High Concealment
	5 - High Concealment
- [X] In the Segment section under POD, exclude "Primary Target:x" Note.
	- Instead the large blue font should say "Primary POD", and there should be another slightly smaller but still fairly large bold font that says "Average POD"
	- The average POD would be the straight-line average of all things selected to be searched for
	- The primary POD follows the order of operations as:
		1. Adult
		2. Child
		3. Large item
		4. Small item
- [X] In the segment section, exclude calculation details drop-down from the POD section
- [X] Under segment the segment start time and end time is not a 24-hour clock
	- Just call it segment start time and segment end time. Don't put the 24-hour HHMM in brackets after
	- The selection should be a 24-hour clock; this is standard practice in SAR
- [X] Under Evidence/Historical Search, for the searching for options, it should first be a selection between remains and evidence, or both.
	- Then when remains is selected, sub-options of intact remains, partially skeletonized remains, or skeletal remains appear. And under evidence, large evidence or small evidence, appears.
	- This is because you might be looking for remains and evidence or just remains or just evidence
- [X] Under active missing person you should not be able to deselect adult, child, large clue, or small clues. One must be selected
